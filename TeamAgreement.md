# Conflict Plan
- Your team should agree on a process for handling disagreements, should they arise. It is better to have a plan in place ahead of time so you can all refer back to it when necessary.
## What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?
- Hold a vote between all members after hearing each party’s pitch. If a conflict occurs between multiple members, we will all discuss each side of the issue, with its pros and cons, and decide on the appropriate compromise to resume work as efficiently as possible.
## What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?
- Other party members will bring it up to the individual and we will discuss as a group to decide on the best path moving forward
## How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
- Allowing each member to work based off their relative strengths, so that those at different skill levels can each contribute in a meaningful and impactful way. It is impossible to focus on everything at once, so everyone has refined their skill set differently in different areas, and will bring something new to the table.
## How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?
- Every few days, we will take a poll on an anonymous survey asking the team if everyone is adequately contributing. If there are answers that mention someone might not be, we can talk about it openly. 
## How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?
- If 15 minutes have passed from the moment the conflict started, we will attempt to reach a third-party mediator.

# Communication Plan

## What hours will you be available to communicate?
- Jasmine: Slack at all hours
- Oz: Email or Slack at all hours
- Cam: During the day can respond on slack, fully present after 6:30 pm PST
- Lilian: Slack, email
- Sam: Slack at all hours, will be in remo in the times designated above.
## What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?
- Slack, email, remo
## How often will you take breaks?
- Fluid, changing per person.
## What is your plan if you start to fall behind?
- In case someone gets sick, we can all divide the workload. If we are behind our scheduled goals, we will focus on completing the terms of the project before making extras work.
## How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?
- Email or slack, so it can be checked on when that person is available.
## What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?
- Open mic minute at the end of meetings, where anyone who didn’t get a chance to speak on their point or wanted to address something else can bring that up and be heard out.
## How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?
- Encouragement, sending memes, if offering criticism it should be constructive, ensuring interruptions are kept to a minimum and everyone can finish their points, having a relaxed approach.

# Work Plan
## Explain your work plan to track whether everyone is contributing equally to all parts of the project, and that each person is working on “meaty” problems. This should prevent “lone wolf” efforts and “siloed” efforts.

- Sam notes:
- Apparent tasks:
- Deploy Linux-based file server
- Set up Linux file server to only be accessible to executive team
- Configure Windows 10 systems to connect to the Linux file server
- Create Gmail accounts for executives
- Install Mozilla Thunderbird on the Windows 10 systems
- Configure Thunderbird clients to access Gmail accounts
- Automount the Linux shared folder as drive L: for the user
- Deploy a Microsoft Windows Server 2016 Base with Containers instance on AWS EC2
- Establish SOP for secure access to the Microsoft Windows Server 2016 instance
- Configure desktop backups to the Linux file server
- Schedule nightly user profile backups to the Linux file server
- Schedule weekly OS-level backups to the Linux file server
- Deploy a shared LAN for the Windows 10 endpoint and Linux file server
- Configure remote access to Windows 10 endpoint for executive team
-  Provide GUI-based connectivity to Windows 10 endpoint for non-technical executive team.


### NOTE: While researching and experimentation is always encouraged, writing and/or committing code to the project on your own during non-working hours or over the weekend is never acceptable. This puts the entire project at risk. Be explicit in calling out your work hours and the distribution of tasks.
## How will you identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?
- Based off a visual diagram and ordered list, tasks will be assigned to the relevant individuals at the ideal time. The diagram above can be referred to for reference on individual project priority:
